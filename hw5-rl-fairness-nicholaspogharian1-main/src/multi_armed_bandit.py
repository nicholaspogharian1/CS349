        Trains the MultiArmedBandit on an OpenAI Gym environment.

        See page 32 of Sutton and Barto's book Reinformcement Learning for
        pseudocode (http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).
        Initialize your parameters as all zeros. For the step size, use
        1/N, where N is the number of times the current action has been
        performed. (This is the version of Bandits we saw in lecture before
        we introduced alpha). Use an epsilon-greedy approach to pick actions.

        See (https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) for examples of how to use the OpenAI
        Gym Environment interface.

        In every step of the fit() function, you should sample
            two random numbers using functions from `src.random`.
            1.  First, use either `src.random.rand()` or `src.random.uniform()`
                to decide whether to explore or exploit.
            2. Then, use `src.random.choice` or `src.random.randint` to decide
                which action to choose. Even when exploiting, you should make a
                call to `src.random` to break (possible) ties.

        Please don't use `np.random` functions; use the ones from `src.random`!
        Please do not use `env.action_space.sample()`!

        Hints:
          - Use env.action_space.n and env.observation_space.n to get the
            number of available actions and states, respectively.
          - Remember to reset your environment at the end of each episode. To
            do this, call env.reset() whenever the value of "terminated or truncated" returned
            from env.step() is True.
          - When choosing to exploit the best action rather than exploring,
            do not use np.argmax: it will deterministically break ties by
            choosing the lowest index of among the tied values. Instead,
            please *randomly choose* one of those tied-for-the-largest values.
          - MultiArmedBandit treats all environment states the same. However,
            in order to have the same API as agents that model state, you must
            explicitly return the state-action-values Q(s, a). To do so, just
            copy the action values learned by MultiArmedBandit S times, where
            S is the number of states.

        Arguments:
          env - (Env) An OpenAI Gym environment with discrete actions and
            observations. See the OpenAI Gym documentation for example use
            cases (https://www.gymlibrary.dev/api/core/).
          steps - (int) The number of actions to perform within the environment
            during training.

        Returns:
          state_action_values - (np.array) The values assigned by the algorithm
            to each state-action pair as a 2D numpy array. The dimensionality
            of the numpy array should be S x A, where S is the number of
            states in the environment and A is the number of possible actions.
          rewards - (np.array) A 1D sequence of averaged rewards of length `num_bins`.
            Let s = int(np.ceil(steps / `num_bins`)), then rewards[0] should
            contain the average reward over the first s steps, rewards[1]
            should contain the average reward over the next s steps, etc.

        Hints:
          - You should not update the state_action_values during prediction.
          - Exploration is only used in training. During prediction, you
            should only "exploit."
